This is a write-up of the **Conti** challenge on Tryhackme. **Conti** is an infamous commercialized black hat ransomware most likely of Russian origin, it is sold by RAAS (Ransomware As a service) providers and is/was one of the most popular from 2019 - 2022.

In addition to this software itself, which is attributed to multiple different APTs, there was a group called the Conti Group that also used this Ransomware in attacks.

Mitre has an entry detailing the TTPs of this RAAS here: https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575/
